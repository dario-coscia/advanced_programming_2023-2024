# Exam format

Exams will be held **in-person**.
Students with special needs should contact the instructor in due time.

## Exam structure
The exam will consist of
- 10 open-ended questions.
- 1 or 2 programming exercises.
- An optional oral exam, upon request by either the student or the instructor.

Allowed programming languages include C++, Python, GNU Makefile, CMake, and Bash.

## Question types
- Open-ended and oral questions will test theoretical understanding and application of concepts.
- Programming exercises will assess practical skills in coding and problem-solving.

## Content
The exam will encompass all the topics and material outlined in the [course syllabus](syllabus.md). This includes, but is not limited to, lecture notes, recordings, examples, exercises and their solutions, and any additional resources referenced. Students are expected to be familiar with the entire range of content covered throughout the course for the examination.

# Time allocation

The exam will be 3 hours long.

Each section has a different time allocation:
- 1 hour will be allocated for the 10 open-ended questions.
- The remaining time will be reserved for the programming exercises.

Submissions after the deadline will not be accepted.

# Material allowed

## Open book policy
Students may refer to textbooks, notes, and other resources. This policy is designed to encourage reasoning and the application of knowledge rather than rote memorization.

## Restrictions
- No communication with others is permitted.
- Use of online forums or social media for answers is strictly prohibited.

# Submission guidelines

## Format
The exam submissions will be conducted through the Google Form system. Please make sure to provide valid personal information and email address.

## Open-ended questions
Answers to open-ended questions should be provided in their proper text box, or, where appropriate, uploaded as single source files (`hpp`, `cpp`, `py`, `ipynb` or related file extensions allowed.)

## Programming exercises
Programming exercises must be submitted as a single `.zip` or `.tar` archive containing only source code files, documentation and any other relevant information. **NB**: no object or binary file should be uploaded. Name the archive file with your student ID or name followed by the exercise number (e.g., `123456_ex1.zip`, `Surname_Name_ex1.tar.gz`). Please provide a README.md file with a brief explanation of the code structure and instructions for building and running your code.

# Exam rules

## Honesty and plagiarism
Academic integrity must be upheld. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Always cite your sources and ensure that your work is entirely your own. Any form of academic dishonesty and cheating will result in severe penalties or disqualification.


## Questions and technical issues
If you encounter questions or technical issues during the exam, please inform the exam invigilator immediately.

# Evaluation criteria

All the answers and code must be original and written by the student. You are encouraged to use any resource, including books, notes, and online documentation, for reference and learning. However, make sure to acknowledge any external sources you consult in your documentation.

## 10 open-ended questions (up to 1.5 points each)
- Clarity of expression.
- Depth of understanding of the theoretical concepts.
- Application and analysis of knowledge.

## Programming exercises (up to 15 points)
- Correctness and efficiency of the code.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- Code testing and syntax correctness.
- Proper use of programming constructs and data structures covered during the course.
- Code documentation and comments, explaining how to build and run the program, its logic and flow.
- Successful compilation and execution, fulfilling the given problem statement.
- Use of programming constructs and data structures beyond the course content.

## Homework assignments (up to 3 points, optional)
The average of students' scores for homework assignment, divided by 10, will be added to the exam grade.

## The maximum achievable grade is 30.
Honors may be granted in exceptional cases, provided the final grade exceeds 30.

The optional oral exam may increase or decrease the student's grade by up to 3 points.
